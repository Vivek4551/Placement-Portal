Placements in the industry and alignment of career with role, brand and package is to be regarded
as the most critical goals of professional education. Though learning must be recognized as an end
in itself, it is important that professional education facilitates the process of career advancement
of students. Moreover, it has been seen that right placement happens as much because of individual
brilliance and aptitude as because of strategic preparedness. The university visualizes its role as a
facilitator to bring about a radical change in the employability of its students. Consequently, a
comprehensive placement policy has been framed keeping in mind the aspirations of the students,
their parents and expectations of the industry.
The Placement Services of the University will be available only to those students who opt to avail
them and commit to abide by the requirements thereof.
As per current recruitment trends, the recruitment activity starts early in pre-final year / semester
(depending on the program). Students graduating in 2024 are required to gear up for being a part
of placement related activities immediately at an early stage of their program.
